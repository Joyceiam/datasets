This project entailed using machine learning algorithms to predict startup success. A ccomparison is made between focusing on the 
founder vs the business metrics. These were curated from research on the internet using publicly available data.
I've made the dataset public for others who are interested in this area. I dont mind collaborating 
in the future with interested parties.
